**Random  Multimodel  Deep  Learn-ing (RMDL):**   a   new   ensemble,   deep   learning   approach   for classification.  Deep  learning  models  have  achieved  state-of-the-art  results  across  many  domains.  RMDL  solves  the  problem of  finding  the  best  deep  learning  structure  and  architecture while simultaneously improving robustness and accuracy through ensembles  of  deep  learning  architectures.  RDML  can  accept  asinput a variety data to include text, video, images, and symbolic.

**Documentation:**
The continually increasing number of complex datasets each year necessitates ever improving machine learning methods for robust and accurate categorization of these data. This paper introduces Random Multimodel Deep Learning~(RMDL): a new ensemble, deep learning approach for classification. Deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art results across many domains.  RMDL solves the problem of finding the best deep learning structure and architecture while simultaneously improving robustness and accuracy through ensembles of deep learning architectures. RDML can accept as input a variety data to include text, video, images, and symbolic. This paper describes RMDL and shows test results for image and text data including MNIST, CIFAR-10, WOS, Reuters, IMDB, and 20newsgroup. These test results show that RDML produces consistently better performance than standard methods over a broad range of data types and classification problems.
